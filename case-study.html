          </div>
          <p>Inspired by the success of services like Google Drive, Dropbox and Pinterest,
            my client aimed to take the best of today’s cloud storage tools, and turn them into tomorrow’s necessity.
            To do that, they needed a brand and a design that would make their solution
            a seamless addition to the modern influencer’s toolkit.</p>

          </div>
          <p>My research indicated that cloud storage users are split across multiple cloud storage services that only partially address their needs.
            I saw an opportunity for a simple and easy-to-use service,
            that integrates with existing tools and offers organization, editing and collaboration
            for spreadsheets, planning documents and projects.</p>

              Next, I turned my research to branding. My client required a name and an entirely new look and feel for their product. To begin, I analyzed the use of color, iconography, and tone by my competitors, and brainstormed branding themes. I explored many directions, including emphasizing the planning utility of the tool in the name, or claiming another container name like “drawer”, “bucket” and “wagon”. I then sketched logos for these options and iterated on my favorite themes.

            <p>
              Based on feedback from a sample of users and designers, I decided to focus on the name “Spil”. The name is short and sweet, easy to pronounce, and easy to remember. It alludes to the broader theme of sharing and collaborating on ideas, and invites a visual design that incorporates painting and other creative projects. I sketched additional logo options to refine my ideas, and vectorized my favorites.

            <img src="images/logo-vectors.png" alt="Logo vectors">

              I decided on a simple logo, with only the Spil name, featured in Montserrat and accompanied by a single spilled drop of paint. Finally, I documented my finalized logos, alongside my typeface and color choices, in my Spil Style Guide.

            <p>I reviewed my prototype over and over again until I had consistently incorporated all feedback. Finally, I had a version that I was proud to present to my client.
              <br>
              <br>The core needs of a cloud storage product were complicated enough to execute in a clean UI - I knew this problem well from my research. But as I was trying to push the envelope and design a real improvement to the status quo, I found myself split between delivering the best cloud storage product, and the most innovative cloud storage product.
              <br>
              <br>Unfortunately, this occasionally meant limiting the final presentation of core features like search, and at the same time, limiting my investment in designing additional real-world examples of the boards that would distinguish the product from its peers.

            If I had more time, I would simulate entire workflows executed with Spil. These might include spelling out each step required to build one complete trip planning board. In the future, I would begin by limiting the scope of my solution even more, and focus on one problem at a time. I could prioritize perfecting the file manager experience, and perhaps focus on a specific type of file or content.
            <br>
            <br>This project made it clear that a narrow focus can always be expanded, but a disparate focus with many interdependencies is hard to narrow down.
