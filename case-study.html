        <h2>THE SITUATION</h2>
        <p>Today we are more connected than any humans that have ever lived before us.
          We can share our ideas with friends around the world.
          We can collaborate in real-time. Inspired by the success of services like Google Drive, Dropbox and Pinterest,
          my client aimed to take the best of today’s tools, and turn them into tomorrow’s necessity.
          To do that, they needed a brand and a design that would make their cloud storage solution
          a seamless addition to the modern influencer’s toolkit.</p>

      <div class="solution grey-box">
        <h2>MY TAKE</h2>
        <p>My research indicated that cloud storage users are split across multiple services that answer only parts of their needs.
          They prioritize easy access to their content across devices and the ability to create, edit and collaborate
          on both personal and professional content.
          They appreciate an all-in-one service that is simple and easy to use,
          that integrates with their existing tools and offers organization, editing and collaboration features
          for spreadsheets, planning documents and projects.</p>

        <p>My work began with an analysis of the biggest players in the cloud storage game: Google, Dropbox and Pinterest.</p>

        <p>I learned that today’s solutions assume content storage, organization and sharing, but fail to deliver on all the details.
          My analysis pointed to an opportunity to create a tool that would combine
          Google’s intuitive user flows with Dropbox’s clean interface and Pinterest’s board and link sharing.</p>

        <p>
          Next, I turned my research to branding. My client required a name and an entirely new look and feel for their product. To begin, I analyzed the use of color, iconography, and tone by my competitors, and brainstormed branding themes. I explored many directions, including emphasizing the planning utility of the tool in the name, or claiming another container name like “drawer”, “bucket” and “wagon”. I then sketched logos for these options and iterated on my favorite themes.
        </p>
        <img src="images/brand-sketches.png" alt="Brand sketches">
      </div>
      <div class="bottom-right">
        <p>
          Based on feedback from a sample of users and designers, I decided to focus on the name “Spil”. The name is short and sweet, easy to pronounce, and easy to remember. It alludes to the broader theme of sharing and collaborating on ideas, and invites a visual design that incorporates painting and other creative projects. I sketched additional logo options to refine my ideas, and vectorized my favorites.
        </p>
        <img src="images/logo-vectors.png" alt="Logo vectors">
        <p>
          I decided on a simple logo, with only the Spil name, featured in Montserrat and accompanied by a spilled drop of paint. To refine this logo and the overall brand, I created a moodboard with my ideal palettes, typefaces, photos and designs. I selected photos that emphasized the necessary balance between clean, satisfying lines and the mess of the creative process. Finally, I documented my finalized logos, alongside my typeface and color choices, in my Spil Style Guide.

        <h2>WRAPPING IT ALL UP</h2>
        <p>I reviewed my prototype over and over again until I had consistently incorporated all feedback. Finally, I had a version that I was proud to present to my client.
          <br>
          <br>The core needs of a cloud storage product were complicated enough to execute in a clean UI - I knew this problem well from my research. But as I was trying to push the envelope and design a real improvement to the status quo, I found myself split between delivering the best cloud storage product, and the most innovative cloud storage product.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="bottom-right">
        <p>
        <br>
        Unfortunately, this occasionally meant limiting the final presentation of core features like search, and at the same time, limiting my investment in designing additional real-world examples of the boards that would distinguish the product from its peers.
        <br>
        <br>If I had more time, I would simulate entire workflows executed with Spil. These might include spelling out each step required to build one complete trip planning board. In the future, I would begin by limiting the scope of my solution even more, and focus on one problem at a time. I could prioritize perfecting the file manager experience, and perhaps focus on a specific type of file or content.
        <br>
        <br>This project made it clear that a narrow focus can always be expanded, but a disparate focus with many interdependencies is hard to narrow down.
